Tasks
====================

Task                                               | Description
---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------
dependencyCheck                                    | Runs dependency-check against the project and generates a report.
[dependencyCheckUpdate](configuration-update.html) | Updates the local cache of the NVD data from NIST.
[dependencyCheckPurge](configuration-purge.html)   | Deletes the local copy of the NVD. This is used to force a refresh of the data.

Configuration: dependencyCheck
====================
The following properties can be configured for the dependencyCheck task:

Property             | Description                        | Default Value
---------------------|------------------------------------|------------------
autoUpdate           | Sets whether auto-updating of the NVD CVE/CPE data is enabled. It is not recommended that this be turned to false. | true
cveValidForHours     | Sets the number of hours to wait before checking for new updates from the NVD.                                     | 4
failBuildOnCVSS      | Specifies if the build should be failed if a CVSS score above a specified level is identified. The default is 11; since the CVSS scores are 0-10, by default the build will never fail. | 11
format               | The report format to be generated (HTML, XML, VULN, ALL).                                                          | HTML
outputDirectory      | The location to write the report(s). This directory will be located in the build directory.                        | build/reports
skipTestGroups       | When set to true (the default) all dependency groups that being with 'test' will be skipped.                       | true
suppressionFile      | The file path to the XML suppression file \- used to suppress [false positives](../general/suppression.html)       | &nbsp;
hintsFile            | The file path to the XML hints file \- used to resolve [false negatives](../general/hints.html)       | &nbsp;
skipConfigurations   | A list of configurations that will be skipped. This is mutually exclusive with the scanConfigurations property.    | `[]` which means no configuration is skipped.
scanConfigurations   | A list of configurations that will be scanned, all other configurations are skipped. This is mutually exclusive with the skipConfigurations property.    | `[]` which implicitly means all configurations get scanned.

#### Example
```groovy
dependencyCheck {
    autoUpdate=false
    cveValidForHours=1
    format='ALL'
}
```

### Proxy Configuration

Property          | Description                        | Default Value
------------------|------------------------------------|------------------
server            | The proxy server; see the [proxy configuration](../data/proxy.html) page for more information. | &nbsp;
port              | The proxy port.                    | &nbsp;
username          | Defines the proxy user name.       | &nbsp;
password          | Defines the proxy password.        | &nbsp;
connectionTimeout | The URL Connection Timeout.        | &nbsp;

#### Example
```groovy
dependencyCheck {
    proxy {
        server=some.proxy.server
        port=8989
    }
}
```

### Advanced Configuration

The following properties can be configured in the dependencyCheck task. However, they are less frequently changed. One exception
may be the cvedUrl properties, which can be used to host a mirror of the NVD within an enterprise environment.
Note, if ANY of the cve configuration group are set - they should all be set to ensure things work as expected.

Config Group | Property          | Description                                                                                 | Default Value

#### Example
```groovy

    data {
        directory='d:/nvd'
    }
}
```

### Analyzer Configuration

In addition to the above, the dependencyCheck plugin can be configured to enable or disable specific
analyzers by configuring the `analyzers` section. Note, specific file type analyzers will automatically
disable themselves if no file types that they support are detected - so specifically disabling the
analyzers is likely not needed.

Property              | Description                                                               | Default Value
