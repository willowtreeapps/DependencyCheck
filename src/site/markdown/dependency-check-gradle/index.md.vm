Usage
==============================
The OWASP dependency-check-gradle plugin provides monitoring of the projects dependent
libraries; creating a report of known vulnerable components that are included in the build.

It is important to understand that the first time this task is executed it may
take 5-20 minutes as it downloads and processes the data from the National
Vulnerability Database (NVD) hosted by NIST: https://nvd.nist.gov

After the first batch download, as long as the plugin is executed at least once every
seven days the update will only take a few seconds.

$H$H Quick Start

$H$H$H Step 1, Apply dependency-check-gradle plugin
Install from Maven central repo

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'org.owasp:dependency-check-gradle:${project.version}'
    }
}

apply plugin: 'org.owasp.dependencycheck'
```

$H$H$H Step 2, Run the dependencyCheck task

Once the dependency-check plugin is applied, if the [Java plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html)
is being used dependency-check will automatically be added to the `check` task.
Alternatively, you can run dependency-check directly:

```bash
gradle dependencyCheck --info
```

The reports will be generated automatically under `build/reports` folder.

$H$H Task Configuration
The OWASP dependency-check-gradle plugin contains three tasks: [dependencyCheck](configuration.html),
[dependencyCheckUpdate](configuration-update.html), and [dependencyCheckPurge](configuration-purge.html).
Please see each tasks configuration page for more information.
