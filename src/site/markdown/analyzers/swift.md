SWIFT Package Manager Analyzer
================

*Experimental*: This analyzer is considered experimental. While this analyzer may 
be useful and provide valid results more testing must be completed to ensure that
the false negative/false positive rates are acceptable. 

OWASP dependency-check includes an analyzer that will scan the [SWIFT Package
Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/)'s `Package.swift` file to obtain information on the dependencies used.

Files Types Scanned: [Package.swift](https://swift.org/package-manager/#example-usage)
