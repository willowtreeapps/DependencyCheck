CocoaPods Analyzer
================

*Experimental*: This analyzer is considered experimental. While this analyzer may 
be useful and provide valid results more testing must be completed to ensure that
the false negative/false positive rates are acceptable. 

OWASP dependency-check includes an analyzer that will analyze SWIFT and Objective-C
packages by scanning [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) specification file.

Files Types Scanned: [*.podspec](https://guides.cocoapods.org/making/specs-and-specs-repo.html)
