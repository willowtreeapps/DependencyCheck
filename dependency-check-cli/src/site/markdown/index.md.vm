About
====================
OWASP dependency-check-cli is an command line tool that uses dependency-check-core to detect
publicly disclosed vulnerabilities associated with the scanned project dependencies. The tool
will generate a report listing the dependency, any identified Common Platform Enumeration (CPE)
identifiers, and the associated Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) entries.

Installation & Usage
====================
Download the dependency-check command line tool [here](http://dl.bintray.com/jeremy-long/owasp/dependency-check-${project.version}-release.zip).
Extract the zip file to a location on your computer and put the 'bin' directory into the
path environment variable.

#set( $H = '#' )

$H$H$H Homebrew
    $ brew install dependency-check

This puts an executable `dependency-check` script in the `/bin` directory of
your homebrew installation.

To scan a folder on the system you can run:

$H$H$H Windows
    dependency-check.bat --project "My App Name" --scan "c:\java\application\lib"

$H$H$H *nix
    dependency-check.sh --project "My App Name" --scan "/java/application/lib"

To view the command line arguments, see the <a href="arguments.html">arguments page</a>, or you can run:

$H$H$H Windows
    dependency-check.bat --help
